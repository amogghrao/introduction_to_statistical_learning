*Statistical learning* refers to vast set of tools for understanding the data. These tools can be classified as *Supervised* or *unsupervised*. 

- **Supervised** : Uses *historical* and *labeled* data, the machine learning model predicts a value.
- **Unsupervised** : Applied to *unlabeled* data, the machine learning model discovers possible pattern in the data.

                   In essence, statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating f.

A set of inputs X are usually available in real life setting, but the output Y cannot be easily obtained. We can predict Y using:


The accuracy of Y_hat as a prediction for Y depends on two quantities:

    - Reducible error
    - Irreducible error
