*Statistical learning* refers to vast set of tools for understanding the data. These tools can be classified as *Supervised* or *unsupervised*. 

- **Supervised** : Uses *historical* and *labeled* data, the machine learning model predicts a value.
- **Unsupervised** : Applied to *unlabeled* data, the machine learning model discovers possible pattern in the data.
